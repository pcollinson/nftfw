<h2 id="what-does-nftfw-do">What does nftfw do?</h2>
<p><em>nftfw</em> provides a simple-to-use framework generating rules
for the latest flavour of packet filtering for Linux, known as
<em>nftables</em>. It generates a set of incoming rules, outgoing rules,
supports a whitelist for ‘friends’ and a blacklist for miscreants.
<em>nftfw</em> glues these rules together and loads them into the
system’s kernel to act as your firewall.</p>
<p>There are five control directories in <em>/etc/nftfw</em> (or it may
be <em>/usr/local/etc/nftfw</em> on your machine). You tell
<em>nftfw</em> to make a rule by adding a file, that’s often empty, to
one of these directories. <em>nftfw</em> uses the file name to
understand what you are asking, and if needed, will use the file
contents to configure the rules it makes.</p>
<p>Here are the directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>incoming.d</em> The incoming directory provides information
to permit selected inbound connections through the firewall. It contains
files that add rules giving the ports that should be available to
external users. When a file has no content, its rule applies to all
comers. Adding IP addresses into the file constrains the rule to apply
only to those addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>outgoing.d</em> The outgoing directory behaves in the same
way as the incoming rule set except that it’s designed to filter
outbound connections. When a file has no content, its rule applies to
all destination IP addresses. If needed, adding specific destination
addresses as content to the file modifies the rule.</p></li>
<li><p><em>whitelist.d</em> The whitelist directory contains files named
for IP addresses, it makes rules to inspect inbound connections to the
system. Packets from these addresses can always access the machine.
Adding port numbers as contents to the a file modifies the rules
allowing the IP address to only access certain services. There’s also an
automatic scanner looking for successful logins into your machine that
will create files in this directory.</p></li>
<li><p><em>blacklist.d</em> The blacklist directory has similar contents
to the whitelist but will block any attempt to access the system from
the IP address. Adding port numbers as contents to the files modifies
the rules to only block access to those services. There’s an automatic
system that looks in log files for people doing bad things and adds
their IP address into this directory.</p></li>
<li><p><em>blacknets.d</em> The blacknets directory contains files
ending in <em>.nets</em>, each file can contain a list of IP network
address ranges in CIDR format. Ranges enable the firewall to use fast
logical operations on numbers to see if an IP address should be be
blocked rather than needing a single rule for each IP. Using blacknets,
it’s possible to cheaply stop access to your server from one or more
countries, or from other large organisations with a diverse address
range.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these directories create a list of rules. The order of the
list is important. The firewall passes each packet from one rule to the
next trying to match the data in the packet with the tests in the rule.
Some rules will be looking for matching IP addresses, some for ports and
some for both addresses and ports. When the firewall finds a match, the
rule tells it to make one of two decisions: accept the packet or reject
it.</p>
<p>The firewall is a filter, continuing with testing until it finds a
decision. For inbound packets, the firewall passes the packet into:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whitelist rules accepting good guys, then</li>
<li>the blacknet rules blocking a wide range of addresses, then</li>
<li>the blacklist rules rejecting known bad guys, then</li>
<li>and finally the incoming rules making decisions about all
others.</li>
<li>If the packet falls out the bottom, then it’s automatically
rejected.</li>
</ul>
<p>For outbound packets, the firewall will accept packets that have no
match with any rule.</p>
<p>If you consider the volume of packets travelling through any machine,
firewall testing seems to be placing a lot of processing between the
inbound network interface and the program ready to receive the next
packet for that port. Processing is considerably reduced by knowing
whether the packet is already part of a conversation or is just starting
one. An early rule in the firewall accepts packets that are part of a
conversation, applying the testing only when the conversation starts.
The firewall filters out most packets before starting testing against
the rules from the directories.</p>
<h3 id="incoming.d">incoming.d</h3>
<p>Here’s what is present in the <em>incoming.d</em> directory for a
standard installation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ls incoming.d</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">05-ping</span>        10-https        30-imaps  50-smtps</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">06-ftp-helper</span>  20-ftp          40-pop3   50-submission</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">07-ssh</span>         21-ftp-passive  40-pop3s  60-sieve</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">10-http</span>        30-imap         50-smtp   99-drop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>None of these files have any content, they are just a filename. Each
filename is a two digit number, a minus sign and a name. The number
provides sorting value for the files and firewall entries made from this
setup will appear in the order that you see. As we’ve seen, order is
important.</p>
<p>There are three possible types for ‘name’ section of the
filename:</p>
<ul>
<li>A port number;</li>
<li>the name of the service in <em>/etc/services</em>;</li>
<li>the name of an action file found in the directory
<em>rule.d</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the name part is a port number or a service name, then
<em>nftfw</em> uses the default <em>accept</em> action from
<em>rule.d</em> to make the necessary rules. The action is given the
port number from the name or from the matching entry in
<em>/etc/services</em>. For example, the file <em>10-http</em> will
create an accept rule for port 80, <em>10-https</em> will create an
accept rule for port 443.</p>
<p>It could be that you are not using the POP protocol for inbound mail
delivery and you can remove <em>40-pop3</em> and <em>40-pop3s</em>.
These services will still be available, but perhaps you don’t want to
offer them to the world.</p>
<p>If you want a service only to work for a limited number of specific
IP addresses, just add the addresses one per line to the file in
<em>incoming.d</em>. You may add a domain name instead of an IP address,
and <em>nftfw</em> will lookup the name, translating it to actual IP
addresses (both types of address: IPv4 and IPv6 if available). It’s a
good idea to run a caching nameserver on your machine if using names, to
prevent slower offsite lookups.</p>
<p>The <em>07-ftp-helper</em> is not a service name. It’s an action file
in <em>rule.d</em> named <em>ftp-helper.sh</em>. It adds in the
essential glue that makes the <em>ftp</em> server work. It’s not needed
it you don’t support <em>ftp</em>.</p>
<p>If you need to create a special script for a standard service, then
you can do so. <em>nftfw</em> gives precedence to action files in
<em>rule.d</em> with the same name as a service.</p>
<p>There are several unused rules in the <em>rule.d</em> directory, a
text file called <em>README</em> lists them.</p>
<h3 id="outgoing.d">outgoing.d</h3>
<p>There are no files <em>outgoing.d</em> directory for a standard
installation. There are some essential rules built into
<em>nftables</em> template for IPv6.</p>
<p>Files in the directory behave the same as those in
<em>incoming.d</em>, except that when they contain IP addresses, then
those addresses will match the destination IP address of the packet
that’s tested.</p>
<p>The default setting <em>outgoing.d</em> is: if no rule matches the
filtered packet then it’s accepted and passed on. Adding a file that
uses a service name or a port number will load a ‘reject’ rule, for
example (you may not want to do this):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">40-ssh</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">42-80</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>will block your machine from sending to an external <em>sshd</em>
server, and also to any external websites. If you want to block access
to a specific site offering these services, then you can add IP
addresses to the file.</p>
<h3 id="blacklist.d">blacklist.d</h3>
<p>To blacklist an address, create a file in <em>blacklist.d</em> named
by the IP address to add the address into the firewall. The
<em>touch</em> command is a simple way to make an empty file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> touch 198.51.100.40 <span class="st">&#39;2001:db8:fab:11::1:0|112&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ls blacklist.d</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">198.51.100.40</span>   2001:db8:fab:11:1:0<span class="kw">|</span><span class="ex">112</span>  203.0.113.204.auto</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first IP address is a version 4 address, and the second a version
6 address. It’s usual to match all but the last character block of an
IPv6 address, this is normally written
<code>2001:db8:fab:11::1:0/112</code> but we can’t use ‘/’ in a Linux
file system, and the convention is to replace this by the vertical bar
‘|’ symbol. Note we have to quote the address when used on the command
line. The blacklist scanner (see below) creates files ending in
<em>.auto</em>, you should leave these alone, the scanner will take care
of them.</p>
<p>An empty blacklist file will block access to all ports to the IP
address given by the name. Adding port numbers into the file, one per
line, will restrict access to only those port numbers. The word ‘all’
can also be added, blocking all incoming ports. If a file contains
‘all’, other port numbers are ignored.</p>
<p>?If your system doesn’t have <em>systemd</em> active directory
installed, you will need to run</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw load</span></code></pre></div>
<p>after you’ve changed the directory contents, or wait for the next
automatic update.</p>
<h3 id="whitelist.d">whitelist.d</h3>
<p>The whitelist directory follows the same basic pattern used to manage
the blacklist directory. To whitelist an address, create a file named by
the IP address. The file content can hold ports if you only want to
allow access to specific services.</p>
<p>The whitelist scanner will create files ending in <em>.auto</em>. See
below.</p>
<p>If your system doesn’t have <em>systemd</em> active directory
installed, you will need to run</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw load</span></code></pre></div>
<p>after you’ve changed the directory contents, or wait for the next
automatic update.</p>
<h3 id="blacknets.d">blacknets.d</h3>
<p>The only rule about filenames in the <em>blacknets.d</em> directory
is that they should end with <em>.nets</em>. Each file should contain a
list of network address ranges, one per line, in CIDR format. See <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation">Wikipedia</a>
if you need more information on the notation. The files support comments
starting with ‘#’.</p>
<p>Mostly, you can find suitable lists on the web, see <a
href="Getting-cidr-lists.html">Getting CIDR Lists</a> for how to install
them. However, there’s nothing to stop you creating your own lists.</p>
<h2 id="starting-with-nftfw">Starting with <em>nftfw</em></h2>
<p>The root user runs_nftfw_ from the command line to create the
firewall:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw load</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It can be run from the <em>systemd</em> daemon whose
<em>nftfw.path</em> service (when installed) triggers a call to
<em>nftfw</em> when files change in one of the action directories. As a
catch-all, <em>cron</em> will run the command once an hour.</p>
<p>The <em>load</em> command tries not to make changes to the kernel’s
tables unless it has to. It creates a set of files that are needed for
the complete ruleset and then compares those files with the set that was
made on the last run. If the files are identical, no change is needed.
The blacklist and whitelist rule sets can be replaced without changing
the whole ruleset. The blacklist rules change most frequently, and an
update to the blacklist is done without disturbing the remainder of the
firewall. In general, all the rules maintain counts of matches, and
these counts are reloaded when the complete firewall is replaced. By
updating only parts of the firewall, these counts become a good
indicator of activity on your system.</p>
<p>The <em>-f</em> or <em>–full</em> flag to the <em>load</em> command
forces the new files to be loaded without reference to the last run.
Consider using the <em>-f</em> flag to force a full reload if you think
that the firewall isn’t working.</p>
<p><em>nftfw</em> uses a configuration file in
<em>/etc/nftfw/config.ini</em> to supply tailoring of various aspects of
its operation. The distributed version contains a complete set of the
default settings, with the values commented out. The <em>-i</em> flag to
<em>nftfw</em> lists all the values that are in force.</p>
<p><em>nftfw</em> will write error messages into
<em>/var/log/syslog</em> using the standard <em>syslog</em> mechanism.
To get an listing of what <em>ntfw</em> is doing, set <em>loglevel</em>
in the config file to <em>INFO</em>.</p>
<p>There are various manual pages - see <a href="man/index.html">Manual
page index</a>.</p>
<p>If you are migrating from another firewall system to <em>nftfw</em>,
now’s the time to look at the <a
href="Debian_package_install.html">Migrating a Sympl or Symbiosis
firewall</a> section of the Package Installation document.</p>
<h2 id="blacklist">Blacklist</h2>
<p><em>nftfw</em> contains a scanner whose job is to watch log files and
add offending IP addresses into <em>blacklist.d</em>. The scanner is
started by:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw blacklist</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and that’s usually run from <em>cron</em> every 15 minutes. If it
makes any changes, it will reload the firewall, usually only changing
the parts of the firewall that it uses.</p>
<p>The rules for scanning are supplied by a set of files in
<em>/etc/nftfw/patterns.d</em>. Files here are named by
<em>‘pattern-name’.pattern</em>. Here’s part of my
<em>apache2.pattern</em> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#  The file we scan for patterns</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">file</span>  = /var/log/apache2/access.log</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># the ports we block, can be the word all</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">ports</span> = 80,443</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#</span></span>
<span id="cb8-8"><a href="#cb8-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#  The patterns we use</span></span>
<span id="cb8-9"><a href="#cb8-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">__IP__.*wget%20http</span></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><a href="#cb8-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">__IP__.*XDEBUG_SESSION_START=phpstorm.*$</span></span>
<span id="cb8-11"><a href="#cb8-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">__IP__.*</span> CONNECT .<span class="pp">*</span>$</span>
<span id="cb8-12"><a href="#cb8-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">__IP__.*%20UNION.*$</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Comments are useful, and comment lines are shown by putting a # at
the start of the line.</p>
<p>The file is split into two sections. The first couple of statements
set the file to be scanned and the ports to be blocked if this pattern
is matched. The rest of the file contains several regular expressions
that match lines in the logfile.</p>
<p>The file statement can contain shell ‘glob’ patterns, for example on
a Symbiosis/Sympl system, you can scan all the website log files by
using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">file</span><span class="op">=</span>/srv/<span class="pp">*</span>/public/logs/access.log</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When scanning files, <em>nftfw</em> remembers the last position it
reached in the a file and restarts from that position. When adding a new
expression to capture some bad line you’ve spotted in a log, it can
sometimes be confusing that the bad guy doesn’t suddenly appear in the
blacklist. <em>nftfw</em> supplies a way round this using the ‘ports’
statement, see below.</p>
<p>The regular expressions contain the ‘magic’ string
<code>__IP__</code> (two underscores at each end) matching an IPv4 or
IPv6 address in the line. If you are a <em>regex</em> novice, then
<code>.*</code> matches ‘anything’ and the <code>$</code> matches the
end of the line. Most matches can be specified using these simple
constructs. Character case is ignored when the expression is matched
against lines from the file.</p>
<p>Regular expressions use several characters to mean something special,
and if you want to match these characters in a line from a log then they
must be preceded by a back-slash (). The characters are:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>\ . ^ $ * + ? ( ) { } [ ] |
</code></pre>
<p>It’s important to use backslash before these characters to make sure
that the expression means what you want it to mean. You can use any of
the Python regular expression syntax to match lines, but <em>nftfw</em>
will complain if unescaped (..) strings appear, these indicate a ‘match
group’, there should only be one - the <code>__IP__</code> . You
<em>can</em> use ‘non-capturing groups’. For example, to provide
alternation, an expression containing <code>(?:word1|word2)</code> will
match ‘word1’ or ‘word2’ at that position in the line.</p>
<p><em>nftfw</em> will ignore matched addresses that are not ‘global’,
so if your system is a gateway with a local network running from it,
local network addresses are not blacklisted. It also ignores addresses
found in the <em>whitelist.d</em> directory. Using the whitelist avoids
any entry for ‘good’ addresses appearing in the blacklist database.</p>
<p>When <em>nftfw</em> finds a match, it stores the IP address, the
ports, the time of first encounter, the time of last encounter and the
matching pattern name in a database. It also stores a running count of
matches found and the number of ‘incidents’, the latter is the number of
runs of the scanner it has taken to make the match count.</p>
<p>If the match count is over a threshold number, defaulting to 10, and
settable in the <em>config.ini</em> file, the scanner will add a file to
the <em>blacklist.d</em> directory, triggering a run of <em>nftfw
load</em> to put the ip address into the blacklist blocking against the
nominated ports. When the match count gets over a second threshold,
default 100, and also settable in <em>config.ini</em>, the blacklist
entry is promoted to blocking all ports.</p>

<p>Once in the firewall, miscreant sites will continue to knock at the
door. They are generally robots, and it’s good to know if they are still
knocking so we can keep them in the firewall. A firewall rule with
logging will write a record into <em>/var/log/syslog</em> and the
database is updated using the special port value of <em>update</em>.
Here’s <em>blacklist-update.pattern</em>:</p>

<p>when detected, the port action just updates the database counts and
time, so you can track if the bad sites have really gone away.</p>
<h3 id="testing-regular-expressions">Testing regular expressions</h3>
<p>It’s often the case that you see a line in a logfile and think ‘I
ought to have a rule for that’. Testing the new line you’ve just added
can be difficult because the logfile reader remembers file positions and
won’t see the line again unless the action re-occurs.</p>
<p><em>nftfw</em> can use a special pattern file, setting
<em>ports=test</em>, that allows you to test the regular expression
against some known content to see if it matches. Copy the pattern file
that you want check out to a new file, here’s a copy of
<em>apache2.pattern</em> in <em>apache2-test.pattern</em>.</p>

<p>The blacklist scanner will ignore any pattern file with
<em>ports=test</em>, but it can be used with the single package
selection option to <em>nftfw</em>. Here’s the testing command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw <span class="at">-x</span> <span class="at">-p</span> apache2-test blacklist</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will use data from <em>apache2-test.pattern</em> and will scan the
named log file. The <em>-x</em> flag scans the log file from the
beginning and will not update the stored file position. The command will
print a table with any matching IP addresses, along with a match count.
The command can be re-run if matches fail after adjusting the regular
expression in the pattern file.</p>
<h2 id="whitelist">Whitelist</h2>
<p>The whitelist scanner is started by</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> sudo nftfw whitelist</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and is usually run from <em>cron</em> every 15 minutes, usually 5
minutes after the blacklist run. If it makes any changes, it will reload
the firewall, usually only changing the parts of the firewall that it
uses.</p>
<p>It’s job is a little simpler than the task faced by the blacklist, it
adds the IP addresses used by users of the machine that have logged in
from a global IP address into the <em>whitelist.d</em> directory.</p>
<p>The whitelist command looks in the system’s <em>wtmp</em> file that
records all user logins and system reboots. It can be set to look in the
<em>wtmp</em> file that just contains today’s activity by changing the
<em>wtmp</em> value in _config.</p>
<h2 id="rules---rule.d">Rules - rule.d</h2>
<p>The <em>rule</em> directory contains small shell scripts that
translate firewall actions named in the <em>incoming.d</em> and
<em>outgoing.d</em> directories into nftables command lines. Default
rules are also used for the whitelist and blacklist generation. Note the
coding and management of these files are different from Symbiosis, but
the same idea is there, a shell file allows easy additions by users. The
files do not run any commands, they output <em>nftables</em> statements
to <em>nftfw</em> which stores them and passes the completed file into
the <em>nft</em> command.</p>
<p><strong>nftfw</strong> runs the scripts though the shell and captures
the output text, appending it to a file holding nftables commands. The
system calls each action file twice, once for IPv4 and again for IPv6.
The processing script uses environment variables to pass parameters into
the shell. The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DIRECTION - is set to either ‘incoming’ or ‘outgoing’. The value is
most often used to select whether the rule should apply to source or
destination IP addresses.</li>
<li>PROTO - is set to either ‘ip’ or ‘ip6’. These names not only supply
the protocol type, but also are the names of the two main tables that
form the basic framework, one for each protocol type.</li>
<li>TABLE - is the name of the table, this is usually ‘filter’, again
defined by the basic framework.</li>
<li>CHAIN - the chain used to add the rule to.</li>
<li>PORTS - selects the ports that the rule should apply to, the value
can be empty, a single port, or an <em>nftables</em> anonymous set,
several ports separated by commas and wrapped in {} braces.</li>
<li>IPS - where the rule needs to apply to specific IP addresses, the
command will have IPS set. Like the PORTS value, ir can be empty, a
single port, or an <em>nftables</em> anonymous set, several ports
separated by commas and wrapped in {} braces.</li>
<li>COUNTER - adds the ‘counter’ statement to the rule. The value is
usually empty, or the word ‘counter’</li>
<li>LOGGER - Finally the LOGGER value is either empty or contains ‘log
prefix “String”’, adding a space after any supplied string from
<em>nftfw</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several examples of these scripts in the
<em>/etc/nftfw/rule.d</em> and the README file in that directory
explains what they do.</p>
<h2 id="rules---local.d">Rules - local.d</h2>
<p>If you want to supply your own rules, or override standard rules in
<em>rule.d</em>, new and alternative rules can be placed in
<em>local.d</em>.</p>
