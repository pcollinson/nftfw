NAME
====

**nftnetchk** â€” command line tool to check if IPs in the firewall database are present in blacknets.d files

SYNOPSIS
======

| **nftnetchk** \[**-h | -l**\]


DESCRIPTION
=========

_nftnetchk_ is a command line tool that checks if the IP addresses in the files in _blacknets.d_ are legal. In addition, it will determine if the IP addresses present in the firewall database are unnecessary because they are part of any network contained in files in _blacknets.d_. Entries in _blacknets.d_  are usually network ranges expressed using CIDR format and are added into _blacknets.d_ by hand. This tool will list entries in the firewall database that are no longer needed because they are covered by the _blacknets.d_ values.

If _nftnetchk_ has nothing to report, it won't output anything.

Output is normally a 'pretty printed' table with these headings:

- IP:  The IP found IP address that can be removed.
- Found in:  The name of the file in _blacknets.d_ of which the network IP is part.
- Net:  The network entry that contains the IP
- Latest:  The date and time of last recorded activity for this address
- First:  The date and time of first recorded activity for this  address ('-' if same as Latest)
- Duration: How long between the Latest and First

The **-l** (or **--list**) option just outputs  IP addresses as a list. The output can be used to remove the IPs from the database:

	sudo nftnetchk -l | while read ip; do sudo nftfwedit -d $ip; done
