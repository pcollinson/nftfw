These scripts are called from within python to generate text
lines for the nftables setup. The job of the code is to add rule commands
using echo and other shell output techniques. This directory might be updated
on a new installation. Local rules should be added in local.d. Files in local.d
with the same name supersede files in this directory.

When files are updated, the previous version is shown by adding '.replaced'
to the name. These files can be deleted.

Each rule is called twice, once for ip and once of ip6

The environment is set up as follows:
DIRECTION incoming | outgoing
PROTO - values ip|ip6
TABLE - usually filter
CHAIN - chain to add the rule to
PORTS - ports to use (can be empty)
COUNTER - set to counter or empty
IPS - ip addresses (can be empty, single, ranges, named sets, unnamed sets)
LOGGER - logger statement
       To replace this in a script use
       LOGGER='log prefix "STRING "'
       the space at the end of the string is needed
       to add a space in the log file

Files:
allowtcpreset.sh       - allow tcp resets
accept.sh              - general default accept ruleset
drop.sh                - use as a default reject rule to drop packets
dryrundrop.sh	       - use as a testing rule for drop.sh
essential-icmpv6.sh    - accept necessary IPv6 ICMP
established.sh         - accept established connections - simply exits
                       - Symbiosis compatibility, rules to do this
		       - are in nftfw_init.nft
ftp-helper.sh          - Add ftp helper for the ftp
ftp-passive.sh	       - Add Passive inbound ports needed for pure-ftpd
		         If not using pure-ftp edit the script to provide ports
			 NB this script does nothing unless it's edited to
			 supply a port range or pure-ftp is installed.
http-meter.sh          - replace http and https by a metering
                       - call to stop http(s) flooding
                       - needs load-http-meter
icmp.sh		       - allow ICMP for ipv4 only
icmpv6.sh	       - allow ICMP for ipv6 only
load-http-meter.sh     - establish chain for http(s) metering
