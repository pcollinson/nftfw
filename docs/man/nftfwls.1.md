NAME

**nftfwls** \- list **nftfw** blacklist database

SYNOPSIS
======

| **nftfwls** \[**-h**\] \[**-c** _config_]  \[**-p** yes|no \] \[**-a |-r | -m | -i | -n | -w | -q | -v | -g **\]


DESCRIPTION
=========

**nftfwls** displays the status of the database storing the state of the **nftfw** firewall. The default output only displays the IP addresses found in _/etc/nftfw/blacklist.d_. The **-a** option shows all entries in the database, and ignores the contents of the _blacklist.d_ directory. HTML output is also possible.

**nftfwls** 'pretty prints' a table with these headings:

-  IPs:   The blocked IP address
- Port: The port list used in the firewall for the IP
- Ct/Incd: The number of matches in log files triggered by this IP; a / and the number of reported distinct incidents
- Latest: The date and time of the latest incident. The _date_fmt_ key in _config.ini_ can alter  date formats from the default.
- First: The date and time of the first incident (or a minus sign '-' if it's the same as Latest)
- Duration: The time difference between the two times
- Pattern: The pattern or patterns that reported the incident or incidents

If the _geoip2_ country database is available, the IP address is preceded by the ISO two letter country code of te site where the IP is located.

Text output
----------

Text output uses the Python 'prettytable' module. When piping the output into another program, it's helpful to remove the column separators, adding **-n** option make this happen.

HTML output
-----------
The **-w** option selects HTML output. It prints an HTML table suitable for inclusion on a web page. Classes in the table allow styling.

- Class: 'nftfwls' - for <table\>
- Class: 'heading' for the heading <tr\>
- Class; 'content' for the remaining <tr\> lines
- Class: 'col1', 'col2', up to 'col7' for the appropriate <td\> cells.

If the _geoip2_ country database is available, the IP address is preceded by the ISO two letter country code of te site where the IP is located. Mouse over the code to get the full country name.
