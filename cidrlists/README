These two files provide support to automate download of GeoIP files to provide
CIDR files for blocking access by country.

See the document Getting-cidr-lists.md

getgeocountry - add into /var/lib/GeoIP to download the zip file, unpack it and
	      create a sqlite3 database.

getcountrynet - install to obtain CIDR lists for a specific country or countries.
	      Country is two letter ISO code
	      can be given -4 or -6 to limit IPs to networks to that flavour
	      for countries that follow

These tools need the sqlite3 package installed.

NB. As of February 2022, the filename extraction in getgeocountry failed because
the format changed. A new version is provided here. The format added an extra field
in May 2024 and a new version is provided.
