</header>
<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p><strong>nftfw-config</strong> - configuration file for the nftfw
system</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A standard ‘ini’ file configures the nftfw(1) system, it’s stored in
<em>/etc/nftfw/config.ini</em> or
<em>/usr/local/etc/nftfw/config.ini</em>. The file uses the standard
conventions for commenting and makes use of several sections. Empty
values can be specified by just using a keyword.</p>
<p>The program starts with a built-in version of the settings, then
reads the <em>config.ini</em> file. As distributed, the installed file
has all variables commented out using semi-colons.</p>
<p>Values for the main <strong>nftfw</strong> script can be overridden
by using the <strong>-o</strong> option. The <strong>-i</strong> option
prints keys and values.</p>
<p>There are several sections in the file.</p>
<p><strong>[Locations]</strong></p>
<p>The locations section defines the paths to files and directories used
by the system. The program looks in <em>/etc</em> and then
<em>/usr/local/etc</em> for the <em>nftfw</em> directory determining the
‘root’ key and that forms the basis for all paths.</p>
<p><em>sysetc</em>, <em>sysvar</em> These two variables contain the
control and working files for the system:</p>
<pre><code>  sysetc = ${root}/etc/nftfw
  sysvar = ${root}/var/lib/nftfw</code></pre>
<p><em>nftables_conf</em> <strong>nftfw</strong> needs to know where the
system writes <em>nftables.conf</em> file that provides input to
<em>nftables</em> on system reboot. On installation, the file is written
into <em>/etc/nftfw</em> for safety. The variable needs changing to
<em>/etc/nftables.conf</em> when the system is live.</p>
<pre><code>  nftables_conf = ${sysetc}/etc/nftables.conf</code></pre>
<p><em>nftfw_init</em> The location for the initial nft setup file
containing the framework used by the firewall.</p>
<pre><code>  nftfw_init = ${sysetc}/nftfw_init.nft</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Rules]</strong></p>
<p>This section provides tailoring of the default rules used in the five
processing sections of the program when rules are not explicitly
given.</p>
<pre><code>  incoming = accept
  outgoing = reject
  whitelist = accept
  blacklist = reject
  blacknets = drop</code></pre>
<p>The key on the left is a program section name and the value is the
name of a rule. A possible choice for ‘reject’ is the ‘drop’ rule which
simply throws inbound packets away. The ‘reject’ rule jumps to a table
in the initialisation script that actively rejects the packet.</p>
<p><strong>[Logging]</strong></p>
<p><em>logfmt</em> Set the format of log statements (see the Python
<em>logging</em> documentation for possible formats)</p>
<pre><code>  logfmt = nftfw[%(process)d]: %(message)s</code></pre>
<p><em>loglevel</em> Sets the level are we logging at, this value needs
to be a level name not a value. Choose one of CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING,
INFO, DEBUG. <strong>nftfw</strong> uses the <strong>-v</strong> flag to
the set this value to INFO. On installation, the log level is set to
INFO and can be changed to ERROR to reduce information written into the
logs.</p>
<pre><code>  loglevel = INFO</code></pre>
<p><em>logfacility</em> The logging facility are we using, it needs to
be a facility name not a value.</p>
<pre><code>  logfacility = daemon</code></pre>
<p><em>logprint</em> Control printing of logged information. Set to
False to inhibit log printing at the console. This value is initially
set to False when the program is not talking to a terminal.
<strong>nftfw</strong> uses the <strong>-q</strong> flag to the set this
value to False and the option will suppress printing to the
terminal.</p>
<pre><code>  logprint = True</code></pre>
<p><em>logsyslog</em> Set to False to inhibit syslog use.</p>
<pre><code>  logsyslog = True</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Nft]</strong></p>
<p>This section affects the nftables statements generated by the
rules.</p>
<p>Do we want counters on the statements?</p>
<pre><code>  incoming_counter = True
  outgoing_counter = True
  blacklist_counter = True
  whitelist_counter = True
  blacknets_counter = True</code></pre>
<p>Do we want nftables logging? By adding a different prefix for each of
the tables, it’s possible to scan the syslog for events and get feedback
from the firewall. To stop logging, just use the name.</p>
<pre><code>  incoming_logging
  outgoing_logging
  blacklist_logging = Blacklist
  whitelist_logging
  blacknets_logging</code></pre>
<p>The three variables below control the type of sets automatically
generated for blacklist, blacknets and whitelist tables. When true,
<em>nftfw</em> uses auto_merged, interval sets for the sets it makes.
This type automatically creates entries containing an address range for
adjacent IP addresses. The feature is desirable because it reduces the
number of matches.</p>
<p>However, the auto-merged, interval sets can cause the loading of
<em>nftables</em> rules to fail, flagging an error. A load can succeed
when a full install is performed but partial loads of sets can fail. The
bug was reported to the <em>nftables</em> development team, based on
problems with the Buster release and a fix was generated. The fix is now
widely deployed.</p>
<p><em>nftfw</em> works around this bug, automatically generating a full
install when an attempt at a set reload fails. However, it seems a good
idea to provide a way of turning this feature on and default to not
using the feature.</p>
<p>It seems likely that this problem has been fixed for the Bullseye
Debian release. It’s recommended to enable this feature, but monitor
logs to check that updates are not failing and nftfw is managing to do
installs of sets without reporting errors.</p>
<pre><code>  blacklist_set_auto_merge = False
  whitelist_set_auto_merge = False
  blacknets_set_auto_merge = False</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Whitelist]</strong></p>
<p><em>wtmp_file</em> The <strong>whitelist</strong> command scans the
wtmp file, and this variable is normally empty to use the system
default. Set <em>wtmp_file=utmp</em> to use the system utmp file,
otherwise set a filename in the variable.</p>
<pre><code>  wtmp_file</code></pre>
<p><em>whitelist_expiry</em> Whitelist entries in
_/etc/nftfw/whitelist.d`` are automatically expired by the number of
days in this variable. <strong>Nftfw</strong> computes the delay as the
difference between ‘now’ and the time on the file.</p>
<pre><code>  whitelist_expiry = 10</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Blacklist]</strong></p>
<p>Constants to manage blacklisting depend on the number of matches
found in log files for the specific IP address - the matchcount. The
nftfwls(1) program shows the currently active blacklist and all the
information associated with each IP.</p>
<p><em>block_after</em> When the matchcount goes over this level,
<strong>nftfw</strong> blocks the ip using the ports in the rule
(Symbiosis used 2).</p>
<pre><code>  block_after = 10</code></pre>
<p><em>block_all_after</em> When the matchcount goes over this level,
<strong>nftfw</strong> blocks the ip using all ports.</p>
<pre><code>  block_all_after = 100</code></pre>
<p><em>expire_after</em> <strong>nftfw</strong> removes blocked IPs from
the <em>blacklist.d</em> directory after the number of days in this
value have passed since the last incident. Bad guys keep coming back,
and sometimes re-appear several months after expiry. It’s useful to have
feedback from the firewall to keep them in play while they batter at the
firewall door. The system allows for this, see nftfw_files(5) for
information on patterns that support feedback.</p>
<pre><code>  expire_after = 10</code></pre>
<p>Symbiosis used 2 for this value.</p>
<p><em>clean_before</em> <strong>nftfw blacklist</strong> will remove ip
from the database where there has been no error posted for more than
these number of day, the intention is to keep the database from growing
to huge proportions. A zero value will inhibit this action.</p>
<pre><code> clean_before = 90</code></pre>
<p><em>sync_check</em> <strong>nftfw blacklist</strong> will check
whether the IP addresses in the database that should be active are
actually present in the blacklist directory <em>blacklist.d</em>.
‘Should be active’ means that the addresses have not been automatically
expired. <strong>nftfw</strong> is largely event driven, but events get
missed. So on the basis that if stuff can happen, it will, this code
will recover the correct state of the blacklist directory. It seems
overkill to call this every time the blacklist scanner runs, so it is
executed when number of runs of the scanner is greater than the value of
this variable. The default is to run the blacklist scanner 96 times a
day, so 50 seems are reasonable way to run the recovery code once a day.
Set this to zero to turn this feature off.</p>
<pre><code> sync_check = 50</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Nftables]</strong></p>
<p><em>nft_select</em> Allow selection of the method used to load/unload
nftables. Permissable values are: <em>shell</em> using the original
interface which calls <em>/usr/sbin/nft</em>, and <em>python</em> uses
python <em>nftables</em> library to load and read <em>nftables</em>.
<em>python</em> is the default. This option may go away in future, it’s
there in case the python code appears to cause problems.</p>
<pre><code>  nft_select = python</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Nftfwls]</strong></p>
<p><em>date_fmt</em> Allows change of date format for <em>nftfwls</em>.
The default is DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM.</p>
<pre><code>  date_fmt = %d-%m-%Y %H:%M</code></pre>
<p><em>pattern_split</em> Replaces any commas in the pattern listing
column by a newline and a space, reducing output width on the terminal
output. Can be overridden by <em>-p</em> option to <em>nftfwls</em>.</p>
<pre><code>  pattern_split = No</code></pre>
<p><strong>[Nftfwedit]</strong></p>
<p>The <em>nftfwedit</em> print function can lookup the IP supplied as
an argument in various DNS blocklists. The function is not enabled until
entries are supplied in this section of the config file. The Python 3
package <em>python3_dnspython</em> must also be installed. I also
suggest that your system runs a caching nameserver.</p>
<p>Sample entries are supplied in the distributed file, and require
un-commenting by removing the initial semi-colon. The entry is
<em>Name=domainname</em>, where the <em>domainname</em> is used to
access the list in the DNS lookup.</p>
