These scripts are called from within python to generate text
lines for the nftables setup. So job of the code is to echo add rule commands
Each is called twice, once for ip and once of ip6

The environment is set up as follows:
DIRECTION incoming | outgoing
PROTO - values ip|ip6
TABLE - usually filter
CHAIN - chain to add the rule to
PORTS - ports to use (can be empty)
COUNTER - set to counter or empty
IPS - ip addresses (can be empty, single, ranges, named sets, unnamed sets)
LOGGER - logger statement
       To replace this in a script use
       LOGGER='log prefix "STRING "'
       the space at the end of the string is needed
       to add a space in the log file
