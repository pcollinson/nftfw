<p><strong>nftfw-files</strong> - documentation of file formats used in
nftfw</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This page documents the file formats used in the
<strong>nftfw</strong> firewall system. The system stores various
control files in <em>/etc/nftfw</em> or <em>/usr/local/etc/nftfw</em>
depending on the installation.</p>
<p>The <em>etc/nftfw</em> directory contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>config.ini</em> - configuration file supplying most ‘constants’
for the code, see nftfw_config(5).</li>
<li><em>nftfw_init.nft</em> - template file holding the basic nftables
framework for <strong>nftfw</strong>.</li>
<li><em>incoming.d</em> - contains rules controlling access to services
on the system;</li>
<li><em>outbound.d</em> - sets any rules controlling packets leaving the
system;</li>
<li><em>whitelist.d</em> - contains IP addresses that have full access
to the system;</li>
<li><em>blacklist.d</em> - specifies IP addresses and ports in the
inbound packets that should not have access;</li>
<li><em>blacknets.d</em> - contains lists of network address ranges
allowing bulk blocking;</li>
<li><em>patterns.d</em> - contain pattern files for matching lines in
log files for blacklist; and</li>
<li><em>rule.d</em> - hold files for generating <strong>nft</strong>
commands from rule names.</li>
<li><em>local.d</em> - locally installed or modified rules should be
placed here to allow for distributions to update rules</li>
</ul>
<p>The distributed files can be found in
<em>etc/nftfw/etc_nftfw</em>.</p>
<h2 id="incoming-and-outbound">incoming and outbound</h2>
<p>Files in these directories specify rules for the firewall. File names
have the format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>number-description</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where ‘number’ is a pair of digits used as a sequence number and
‘description’ specifies the action name needed to created the nftables
commands for the rule.</p>
<p>Descriptions can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a port number inserted into the firewall rule</li>
<li>the name of a service found in <em>/etc/services</em>.</li>
<li>the name of a rule found in the rules directories (with the .sh
suffix removed)</li>
</ul>
<p>When port numbers appear in the filename, the directory name dictates
the action file applied for the rule. The <em>config.ini</em> file
contains variables that select the default rule based on the directory
name (see nftfw-config(1)).</p>
<p>To allow rules to have the same name as services and replace the
default action, <strong>nftfw</strong> searches the local.d and then the
rule.d directories for name matches before querying the service
file.</p>
<p>Files are usually empty, but can contain a list of IP addresses (one
per line) that <strong>nftfw</strong> uses to specify the source IP or
IPs for an incoming rule, or the destination IP or IPs for the outbound
rule. For example, supplying a list of known IP addresses for the
standard ssh(1) service will prevent tiresome exhaustive attempts to get
passwords. Local users can access ssh(1) from unknown addresses using
the knowledge of a random port number given by another rule.</p>
<h2 id="blacklist-and-whitelist">blacklist and whitelist</h2>
<p>Files in these directories make nftables rules permitting access in
the whitelist or blocking access in the blacklist. Whitelisted rules
appear before blacklisted ones in the firewall.</p>
<p>Filenames are simply IP addresses. The whitelist or blacklist
scanners will create files in these directories, and will add a suffix
of <em>.auto</em>. Files added ‘by hand’ should just be the IP
address.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are added in /112 form, with the ‘/’ replaced by a
vertical bar ‘|’. Install IPv4 address groups with network masking using
the same convention.</p>
<p>Empty files mean that the rule applies to all ports. File contents
are lists, one per line, with the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>all - a ‘special’ keyword meaning that the rule applies to all
ports.</li>
<li>a numeric port number</li>
</ul>
<p>Firewall rules with ‘all’ ports appear in the ruleset before any
rules containing specific ports.</p>
<p>The system has no way of distinguishing between TCP and UDP protocols
and the system generates two rules for each rule it finds.</p>
<p>Administrators can disable the blacklist and whitelist systems
separately by creating a file called ‘disabled’ in the relevant
directory.</p>
<p>When building the firewall from these two directories,
<strong>nftfw</strong> writes the IP addresses into nftables sets. The
program writes the information into two separate files and uses file
comparison with the last loaded files to see If it can update the sets
of IP addresses without reloading the whole firewall.</p>
<h2 id="blacknets.d">blacknets.d</h2>
<p>Files in this directory make nftables rules in a single set that
block ranges of IP addresses. Files not ending in <em>.nets</em> are
ignored.</p>
<p>Each file contains a list of IP network addresses, expressed in CIDR
notation, one to a line. The file can also contain comments with the
usual use of # to show them. Lines can contain the following
formats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># IPv4 CIDR 203.0.113.0/24</p>
<p># IPv6 Compressed 2001:DB8::/32</p>
<p># IPv6 Exploded 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/32</p>
<p># IPv4 embedded in IPv6 (will be converted to IPv4) # Format used by
ip2location ::FFFF:203.0.113.0/120</p>
<p># IPv4 embedded in IPv6 (will be converted to IPv4)
::ffff:cb00:7100/120</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theoretically, these are addresses of networks and not interfaces.
The parts of the address that are ‘local’ should be zero. For example in
203.0.113.5/24, the ‘24’ means that the leftmost 24 bits of the 32 bits
are the network address and the 5 is the local part, that should be
zero. However, <strong>nftfw</strong> will accept addresses where bits
are set in these supposedly zero sections and will clear them.</p>
<p>The system can deal with lists for the same country from different
sources, which will inevitably diverge. The system will remove exact
duplicates, and will minimise overlapping address ranges where
possible</p>
<h2 id="patterns.d">patterns.d</h2>
<p>Patterns define rules for the <strong>blacklist</strong> module
containing the log file (or files) for scanning, the port numbers for
the blocking firewall rules, and a list of regular expressions matching
lines in the log file.</p>
<p>Pattern files are text files named <em>name.pattern</em>. The files
support comments when the first character of the line contains ‘#’.</p>
<p>The files contain two ‘equals’ statements that should always be
present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>file = filename ports = port specification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Filename is the full path to a logfile that the pattern will used to
scan. The filename can also contain shell ‘glob’ characters (’*‘,’?’ and
single character ranges) allowing for the rule set to match a range of
files. The blacklist system will ignore the pattern file (and complain)
if the file (or files) that it nominates doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>The port specification is usually a comma separated list of port
numbers. A firewall rule uses the port list to ban access to specific
services on the system. The ports statement has three ‘special’
values:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘all’ will ban access to all ports for any matching IP;</li>
<li>‘update’ allows us to get feedback from the firewall. The ‘update’
value will not create any firewall rules, it will only increment counts
in the system’s sqlite3(1) database for any IP that matches. The option
provides feedback from the firewall that log continued attempts to
access the machine from blocked IP addresses.</li>
<li>‘test’ marks the file as a testing pattern file. The normal scan
from the blacklist system will ignore files with <em>ports=test</em>.
Using the <strong>-p</strong> <em>patternname</em> option with the
blacklist command will consider only files with <em>ports=test</em> and
the pattern file name without the <em>.pattern</em> suffix must match
<em>patternname</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of the pattern file is a set of regular expressions,
placed one per line, that match offending lines in the log files. The
rules all contain the string <code>__IP__</code> (two underscores at
end) used to match and capture the IPv4 or IPv6 address from the line.
Non-empty lines that don’t contain <code>__IP__</code> are flagged as
errors.</p>
<p>The expressions support Python’s standard regular expression syntax
but must only have one matching ‘capturing group’ which is the
<code>__IP__</code> expansion. It is safe to use non-capturing
expressions, for example to match <em>word1</em> or <em>word2</em> in
the line, use <code>(?:word1|word2)</code>.</p>
<p>Lines are flagged in the logs and ignored if the compilation of the
regular expression fails, or if there is more than one matching
group.</p>
<p>The <strong>blacklist</strong> action for <strong>nftfw</strong> uses
the patterns to scan log files for matching lines using case-independent
matching by the regex and finds IP addresses that it adds to an
sqlite3(1) database. IP addresses exhibiting activity levels over a
threshold will cause the script to add the IP address file to the
blacklist directory (see nftfw(1)).</p>
<p>Setting <em>ports=test</em> in a pattern file enables testing to see
if regular expressions pick up offending IP addresses. Set up a pattern
test file pointing to the file you want to scan, and set
<em>port=test</em>, add the regular expression you wish to test. Then
running</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo nftfw -x -p pattern-test blacklist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will use data from <em>pattern-test.pattern</em> and will scan the
named log file (or files). The <em>-x</em> flag scans the log file from
the beginning and will not update the stored file position. The command
will print a table with any matching IP addresses, along with a match
count. The command can be re-run if matches fail after adjusting the
regular expression in the pattern file.</p>
<h2 id="rule.d">rule.d</h2>
<p>The <em>rule.d</em> directory contains small shell scripts that
translate firewall actions named in the <em>incoming.d</em> and
<em>outgoing.d</em> directories into nftables command lines. Default
rules are also used for the whitelist and blacklist generation. Note the
coding and management of these files are different from Symbiosis, but
the same idea is there, a shell file allows easy additions by users. The
files do not run any commands, they output <em>nftables</em> statements
to <em>nftfw</em> which stores them and passes the file into the
<em>nft</em> command.</p>
<p>Filenames have the format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>actionname.sh</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>nftfw</strong> runs the scripts though the shell and captures
the output text, appending it to an nftables command file. The system
calls each action file twice, once for IPv4 and again for IPv6. The
processing script uses environment variables to pass parameters into the
shell. The parameters are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DIRECTION - incoming | outgoing PROTO - values ip|ip6 TABLE - usually
filter CHAIN - table to add the rule to PORTS - ports to use (can be
empty) COUNTER - set to counter or empty IPS - ip addresses (can be
empty, single, ranges, named sets, unnamed sets) LOGGER - logger
statement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pattern script uses the DIRECTION parameter in both incoming and
outgoing contexts and must set directional keywords in
<strong>nft</strong> commands correctly. For an incoming rule, an IP
address (if present) will be a ‘source’ address. For an outgoing rule,
an IP address (if present) will be a ‘destination’ address.</p>
<p>A rule script will usually create a simpler version of the command
when called with no ports.</p>
<h2 id="local.d"><em>local.d</em></h2>
<p>The <em>local.d</em> is the place to add locally modified and created
rules. The directory allows distributions to update <em>rule.d</em>.
<em>local.d</em> is searched before <em>rule.d</em> when looking for
rules.</p>
<h2 id="config.ini"><em>config.ini</em></h2>
<p>The <em>etc</em> directory contains the <em>config.ini</em> file for
<strong>nftfw</strong>. nftfw_config(5) contains a description of the
lines in this file.</p>
<h2 id="nftfw_init.nft"><em>nftfw_init.nft</em></h2>
<p>The file <em>nftfw_init.nft</em> contains the template rule set for
nftables, it’s used to establish the firewall framework and finally uses
several include statements to pull in the files created by the system.
<strong>nftfw</strong> copies the file into the build directory at the
start of the build process.</p>
<p>The file is user-editable, allowing the framework to be changed. The
basic setup assumes that it’s running on a system with a single network
connection attached to the internet. See the example supplied in
<em>nftfw_router_example</em> which provides a router setup with WAN and
LAN connections using <em>nat</em> and <em>forward</em> tables.</p>
<h2 id="etc_nftfw-directory-or-symlink"><em>etc_nftfw</em> directory or
symlink</h2>
<p>Finally, the <em>etc_nftfw</em> directory contains the starting point
for all control files, and some examples. The directory allows
distributions to update the standard control files while not changing
those in use on a running system. <em>etc_nftfw</em> may be a symlink on
some installations pointing to the distribution files stored
elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="files-in-varlibnftfw">Files in <em>var/lib/nftfw</em></h2>
<p>The <em>lib/nftfw</em> directory provides working space for the
system. It contains three directories and several working files.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>build.d</em> - The <em>build</em> directory provides an initial
build space for <strong>nftfw</strong>, it creates a new file set in the
directory from the information available to it. The <strong>nft</strong>
checking function validates the newly installed files, and the update
process will stop for any errors.</li>
<li><em>install.d</em> - The <em>install</em> directory is the source
for the <strong>nft</strong> command to load the tested file set into
the system. On the next run, <strong>nftfw</strong> will compare the
newly generated files in <em>build</em> with that last used set in
<em>install</em>. The comparison determines whether to run a complete or
partial reinstall, or perhaps whether there has been no change. The
intention is to only update blacklist and whitelist set information if
this is possible.</li>
<li><em>test.d</em> - <strong>nftfw -x</strong> runs the build process
up to the point of validating the files and will use this directory as a
target for the build.</li>
<li><em>firewall.db</em> - is an sqlite3(1) database used by the
blacklist command to store state on the IP’s it detects, when and why.
The nftfwls(1) command prints its contents.</li>
<li><em>filepos.db</em> - is an sqlite3(1) database used by the
blacklist command to store the last known position in the log files that
it scans.</li>
<li><em>whitelist_scan</em> - is an empty file, the whitelist command
sets its modification date registering the last run time that the
command was run. The command uses the time to skip over processed
entries in the <em>wmtp</em> file</li>
<li><em>sched.lock</em> - is a lock file used as master lock.
<strong>nftfw</strong> locks the file to prevent other instances from
running. If another instance of the command starts, it will fail to get
the lock, and the queues the intended action before exiting.</li>
<li><em>sched.queue</em> - stores queued actions. The queuing system
permits the storage of only one action of any one type (load, blacklist,
whitelist or tidy). When the master lock owner finishes its task, it
inspects the queue file and performs the job without relinquishing the
master lock. On the last action, lock owner deletes the queue file.</li>
<li><em>queue.lock</em> - is a lock file controlling access to the queue
file.</li>
